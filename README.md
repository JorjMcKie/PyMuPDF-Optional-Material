# PyMuPDF Optional Material

![logo](https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/blob/master/demo/pymupdf.jpg)

This repository contains **Windows-specific** material for [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF), the Python bindings for MuPDF.

~~Apart from a CHM documentation file, this repository contains binary installation files (in a self-made ZIP format).~~

Please note, that we no longer provide binary files in zip format. If you prefer the old **egg** format over wheels, please use a repo like [this](https://github.com/dairiki/humpty) one to convert your preferred wheel to it.

## Directory ``doc``
Contains a **CHM based documentation file**. PyMuPDF itself comes with PDF and HTML based help. If you wish to use a compiled HTML Windows help, left-click [here](https://github.com/JorjMcKie/PyMuPDF-optional-material/blob/master/doc/PyMuPDF.chm).
