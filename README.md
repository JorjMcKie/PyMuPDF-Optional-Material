# PyMuPDF Optional Material

![logo](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF/blob/master/demo/pymupdf.jpg)

This repository contains additional material for [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF), the Python bindings for MuPDF.

~~Apart from a CHM documentation file, this repository contains binary installation files (in a self-made ZIP format).~~

Please note, that we no longer provide binary files in zip format. If you prefer the old **egg** format over wheels, please use a repo like [this](https://github.com/dairiki/humpty) one to convert your preferred wheel to it.

## Directory ``doc``
Contains pre-generated documentation files:

* PyMuPDF help as Windows help file ``PyMuPDF.chm``.
* PyMuPDF help as zipped HTML `pymupdf.zip`.
