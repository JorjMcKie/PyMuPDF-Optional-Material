# PyMuPDF Optional Material

![logo](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF/blob/master/demo/pymupdf.jpg)

This repository contains additional material for [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF), the Python bindings for MuPDF.

## Folder `doc`
Contains pre-generated documentation files for the current PyMuPDF version:

* PyMuPDF help as Windows help file ``PyMuPDF.chm``.
* PyMuPDF help as zipped HTML `pymupdf.zip`.

This material is subject to copyright of (c) 2016-2021 Jorj X. McKie.

## Folder `wheels-upto-Py3.5`
Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 have been retired in 2020 and are no longer maintained. Consequently, PyMuPDF has dropped supporting them. In case you you still need a wheel for those zombies, have a look in this folder.

## Folder `Windows-ZIP-binaries`
Before we started making PyMuPDF wheels, we were experimenting with a self-made ZIP format for Windows. You can find these files here.
