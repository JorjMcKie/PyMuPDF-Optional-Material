# Wheels for Unmaintained Python Versions
These are the latest available PyMuPDF wheels for Python versions, that are no longer maintained:

* Python 2.7
* Python 3.5

The wheels are made available here for your convenience: they may or may not also be found in the main repository's releases folder or on PyPI.

Please note, that there no longer exists issue support for these versions. If you encounter problems, there is no way to resolve them other than upgrading to the current PyMuPDF version.
